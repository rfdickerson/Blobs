* Physics Blobs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rfdickerson/physics-blobs.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/rfdickerson/physics-blobs)

Physics Blobs is a demonstration of simulating spring and gravity physics using numerical integrators such as implicit Euler on an iOS device.

## Features

- [x] Hooke's law for Spring dynamics
- [x] Forward Euler
- [x] Backwards (Implicit) Euler
- [x] DSP vector acceleration (using Accelerate)
- [ ] Collision detection
